<b id="q1">
Why do we need a password hashing competition?
</b>
<br />
<br />
Recent years have seen an increase in the number of significant website
compromises, many of which featured the leakage of user credentials, typically
in the form of hashes of users' passwords. 
These hashes may then be used to recover the actual passwords using optimized
"cracking" techniques, which can be performed relatively efficiently if a weak
password hashing method was employed.
<br />
<br />
This represents a growing threat to privacy on the Internet, since many users
choose weak passwords or share passwords across multiple websites.
<br />
<br />
The severity of these compromises is often exacerbated by the improper use or
configuration of password hashing algorithms. 
Used properly, these algorithms can substantially slow down the recovery of
plaintext credentials.
Unfortunately, many implementers do not deploy these hashes properly, in part
due to poor algorithm choices and lack of guidance from the cryptographic
community. 

The goal of this competition is threefold: 
<ul>
<li>
To promote the development of
best-of-breed algorithms for securing passwords, 
</li>
<li>
To encourage cryptographic
research in this area, and 
</li>
<li>
To develop standards and usage recommendations
for password hashing algorithms.  
</li>
</ul>
<b id="q2">
Isn't it dangerous to use a new algorithm over an existing and well-tested one?
</b>
<br />
<br />
To be clear, submissions of existing constructions are welcome and expected.
The purpose of this competition is not necessarily to choose an entirely new
algorithm. It is as much to promote study and increase our confidence in the
algorithms we have.  <br />
<br />
Moreover, an important secondary purpose of this competition is to encourage
the development of detailed specifications and test vectors. There have been
problems caused by the informal nature of some current functions' specification
(for example, here's an example of an implementation bug that would likely have
been prevented had a comprehensive set of test vectors been available:
<a
href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2483">CVE-2011-2483</a>.)
<br /> 
<br />
<b id="q3">
Why try to come up with new schemes when a major problem now isn't with the
current schemes, but with people's implementations?  
</b>
<br />
<br /> Just because the prevalent problem is with people's choice of password
hashing schemes does not mean that the current solutions are perfect. For
example, PBKDF2 has low memory requirements, which facilitates cracking on
certain platforms. scrypt calls PBKDF2, which calls HMAC, which calls SHA-256,
a nested construction that may seem overly complicated. Recent parallel
processors are expected to bring a considerable speed-up to crack bcrypt
passwords; etc.
<br />
<br />
Also, specific applications may require specific schemes, rather than generic
key-derivation functions. For example, schemes may be needed that fit scripting
languages well, or schemes that are targeted to mobile applications. The PHC
may identify such schemes, which could be incorporated into future
cryptographic standards by NIST, ISO, ANSI, and IETF. 
<br />
<br />
<b id="q4">
Can anyone provide input to the selection, or is this limited to the panel members?
</b>
<br />
<br /> 
The panel exists solely to provide recommendations and guidance. Our
decision will be based on research and commentary supplied by the entire
security community. In fact, this is the entire reason we're holding the
contest.
<br />
<br />
<b id="q5">
Is NIST sponsoring this? Will your results be adopted in their
recommendations?
</b>
<br />
<br /> 
No, NIST is not sponsoring the PHC. However, secure password hashing schemes
are within the scope of NIST's publications. NIST has published "SP 800-132
Recommendation for Password-Based Key Derivation Part 1: Storage
Applications" in 2010. NIST might consider approving similar schemes for other
applications.
<br />
<br />
<b id="q6">
How do requirements differ for password storage and key derivation?  
</b>
<br />
<br /> 
Password storage and key derivation are two classes of applications of
password hashing:  
<ul>
<li>
Password storage is about verification of credentials for using a given
service (typically a web service, but also for unlocking a mobile phone,
logging in an OS, etc.).
</li>
<li>
Key derivation is about generating a cryptographic key from a password,
typically to 'unlock' an encryption service (full-disk encryption, SSH
or PGP private keys, etc.). 
</li>
</ul>
Key derivation tolerates more costly hashing (both in time and memory)
because typical applications are run on a client, whereas the typical
application of password storage is a commercial web service hashing on a
remote server; a too long delay impairs user experience and costs
precious CPU time on the server which, like memory consumption, may be
exploited for DoS unless countermeasures are implemented.
<br />
<br />
<b id="q7">
Why not hashing passwords on the client of a web service to eliminate
  the risk of DoS on the server? 
</b>
<br />
<br /> 
If the server receives a hash rather than a password, a leak of the
hashes database allows to impersonate users without finding their
passwords (as in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_hash">pass-the-hash</a>
attacks).
<br />
<br />
A possible solution to this problem is that the server stores a "fast"
hash of the "slow" hash computed by the client.
However this approach seems difficult to implement because of the
diversity of client platforms (and thus the difference of performance of
the "slow" hash). 
Another approach is that of <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/">SRP</a>,
which hashes password on the client side to create a verifier.
<br />
<br />
<b id="q8">
Why (not) requiring significant memory? 
</b>
<br />
<br /> 
Requiring a significant amount of non-volatile memory (as in scrypt)
tends to decrease the cost-efficiency of massively parallel attacks on
GPUs and hardware (FPGA or ASIC), whereas general-purpose CPUs tend to
support fast-access RAM with several MB of CPU cache.   
<br />
Nevertheless, on platforms such as mobile devices or smartcards,
significant memory requirements may impair performance and/or user
experience.
<br />
<br />
<b id="q9">
"Memory" what? 
</b>
<br />
<br /> 
Memory usage of a password hashing scheme can be characterized by
<ul>
<li>
The amount of storage required (for example, "at least 4 mebibytes") 
</li>
<li>
The number of accesses ("reads") to the memory 
</li>
<li>
The number of modifications ("writes") to the memory
</li>
<li>
The size of data blocks read and written 
</li>
<li>
The order of memory addresses accessed (for example, sequential:
addresses X, X+8, X+16, X+24, etc.)
</li>
<li>
The predictability of memory addresses accessed (for example,
sequentially-ordered accesses are predictable, whereas scrypt's ROMix
accesses are not)
</li>
</ul>
All these characteristics affect the performance and thus security of
the scheme. 
Showing that apparently-unpredictable memory accesses are partially
predictable thus qualifies as an attack.
<br />
<br />
<b id="qa">
Should we care about timing leaks? 
</b>
<br />
<br /> 
If the memory addresses accessed depend on the password hashed, timing
leaks may allow an attacker to obtain information on the password, in
the spirit of <a
href="https://cryptocoding.net/index.php/References#AES_cache-timing_attacks_and_defenses">cache-timing
attacks on AES</a>. 
<br />
<br />
However, to measure timings accurately one needs access to the machine
hashing the passwords (for example, the remote server storing the
hashes), which reduces the likelihood of this type of attack.  
<br />
<br />
<b id="qb">
Why parallelism is often good for a password hashing algorithm?
</b>
<br />
<br /> 
Consider a server equiped with an 8-core CPU, having to choose between
two password hashing algorithms:
<ul>
<li>
Algorithm A cannot be parallelized, and the server uses a single core
of its 8-core CPU to hash passwords (since using 2, 3, or more cores
would not speed-up hashing). 
</li>
<li>
Algorithm B can be parallelized such that with 8 cores it is 8 times
as fast as with a single core. The defender (that is, the server) can
take advantage of this by using all 8 cores of its CPU to hash a
password as fast as algorithm A, but making much more computations. 
</li>
</ul>
Now consider attackers: with N cores they evaluate N instances of
algorithm A in parallel, but only N/8 instances of algorithm B in the
same amount of time.
<br />
<br />
In practice it may not be wise to allocate all cores of a busy server to
password hashing. However for applications such as full-disk encryption
or protection of private keys on desktops it is generally okay to use
more than one core.
<br />
<br />
<b id="qc">
What is "simplicity", and why is it good? 
</b>
<br />
<br /> 
Simplicity of an algorithm refers to
<ul>
<li>
Simplicity of the specification: Clarity and conciseness, design
symmetries (for example, iteration of an identical round function),
reduced number of operations and components, prior knowledge required
(for example, do we need to understand finite fields algebra?).
</li>
<li>
Simplicity of implementation: Are the basic operation easily translated
into machine instructions? (Example: 64-bit integer addition;
counterexample: 128-bit finite-field multiplication.); Is an efficient
implementation similar to the textbook description? (Counterexample: AES
table-based implemetations.) 
</li>
</ul>
Simpler is better for a number of reasons:
<ul>
<li>
"The simplicity of a cipher contributes to the appeal it has for
cryptanalysts, and in the absence of successful cryptanalysis, to its
cryptographic credibility." (<a
href="http://books.google.nl/books/about/The_Design_of_Rijndael.html?id=tfjd6icCUoYC">Daemen
and Rijmen</a>)
</li>
<li>
"Complexity provides both opportunity and hiding places for attackers"
(<a
href="http://chsdemocrats.house.gov/SiteDocuments/20070425145243-10189.pdf">Dan
Geer</a>)
</li>
<li>
The simpler the algorithm, the cheaper it costs to implement, debug, and
test.
</li>
</ul>
<b id="qd">
Is there a formal mathematical definition of the security of a password
hashing scheme? 
</b>
<br />
<br /> 
Attempts of formal definition of secure key-derivation scheme can be
found in
<ul>
<li>
Yao, Yin; <a
href="http://palms.ee.princeton.edu/PALMSopen/yao05design.pdf">Design
and Analysis of Password-Based Key Derivation Functions</a>; CT-RSA 2005
</li>
<li>
Krawczyk; <a
href="https://gnunet.org/sites/default/files/264.pdf">Cryptographic
Extraction and Key Derivation</a>: The HKDF Scheme; CRYPTO 2010
</li>
</ul>
These definitions can be summarized as 'the hash should behave randomly
with respect to any of its input'.  However these definitions only
partially address the actual security of a key derivation scheme (and of
a PHS more generally); they do not address the security informally
defined as 'the scheme should minimize the efficiency of attackers
working with GPUs and FPGAs'.
</b>
</b>
<br />
<br />
<b id="qe">
So what exactly is the attacker we should defend against?
</b>
<br />
<br /> 
At the time of writing, the most cost-efficient attackers run
dictionary-based attacks on GPU clusters, thanks to the high parallelism
of modern GPUs and to the relative ease of programming on those
platforms. Programmable or dedicated hardware circuits (FPGA, ASIC) are
less common, but are also solutions of choice of massively parallel
password cracking.
Password hashing algorithms should thus minimize efficiency on those
platforms, while maximizing efficiency on the target platform(s).
<br /> 
<br /> 
That said, it is difficult to predict how future attackers will look
like.
